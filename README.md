## Introduction

This project is a collection of SQL scripts and exercises aimed at analyzing and extracting insights from datasets. The data could originate from different domains like sales, customer behavior, or financial analysis. Each script is developed with a focus on writing efficient and optimized queries.

## Features

- Querying and manipulating relational databases.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Data transformation and aggregation.
- Designing complex SQL queries.
- Practical examples of SQL in professional use cases.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SatishKore11/sql-data-analytics-project.git
   ```
2. Access datasets and scripts in the folder structure.
3. Use any SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or DB Browser for SQLite) to run the query files.

## Structure

- **Datasets/**: Contains foundational data used for analysis.
- **SQL Scripts/**: Includes all the SQL queries.
- **Documentation/**: Contains detailed explanations for the scripts, insights, and challenges.
  
## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: My primary language for querying, data exploration, and analysis.
- **Database Management Systems (DBMSs)**:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQLite
- Supporting tools for data visualization and reporting.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have enhanced my understanding of:
- Query optimization techniques and performance analysis.
- Importance of database normalization and schema design.
- Leveraging SQL for a variety of data analytics tasks.
